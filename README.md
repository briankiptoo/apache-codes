#Features
#Perform arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication
#Calculate Fibonacci sequence using memoization
#How It Works
#The Node structure defines computation tasks with types (ADD, SUB, MUL) and operands.
#The makeFunc function creates Node instances with specified types and operands.
#The performOperation function executes arithmetic operations based on the given type.
#The fibonacci function calculates Fibonacci numbers using memoization.
#The calc function performs calculations based on Node types and prints results.
##Personal Note
Hey there! This is [Your Name], and I created this small program to demonstrate arithmetic operations and Fibonacci calculation using C.
Feel free to explore and modify the code as needed. Have fun coding!
